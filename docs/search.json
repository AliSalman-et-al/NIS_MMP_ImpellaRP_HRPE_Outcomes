    "text": "This report reproduces the primary, survey-weighted analysis of Impella RP use among adults hospitalized with high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) and cardiogenic shock in the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), 2017–2022. The primary analytic approach uses propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to address measured confounding while retaining the NIS complex survey design.\n\n\nWe used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS), 2017–2022, a stratified, nationally representative sample of U.S. hospital discharges. All analyses accounted for the NIS complex survey design (hospital clustering, stratification, and discharge weights).\n\n\n\nWe included discharges meeting all of the following: - Age ≥ 18 years - Pulmonary embolism present (ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes: I26.01, I26.02, I26.04, I26.09, I26.90, I26.92, I26.93, I26.94, I26.96, I26.99) - Cardiogenic shock present (ICD-10-CM: R57.0)\n\n\n\nImpella RP use was defined by ICD-10-PCS procedure codes 02HA3RZ or 5A0221D during the index hospitalization.\n\n\n\nCovariates were prespecified based on clinical relevance and availability in NIS: - Demographics: age, sex, race (collapsed category), primary payer (collapsed category), ZIP-code income quartile - Hospital factors: region, bed size, location/teaching status - Transfer status: transfer-in, transfer-out - Clinical factors: right ventricular failure, left ventricular failure, Charlson comorbidity index, and year of admission\nRace and payer were collapsed for analytic stability (Native American → “Other”; Self-pay and No charge → “Other”).\n\n\n\nPrespecified in-hospital outcomes were: - In-hospital mortality - Major bleeding and/or transfusion (intracranial hemorrhage diagnosis codes I60–I62 and/or blood product transfusion procedures; see Appendix) - Acute kidney injury (ICD-10-CM: N17.) - Length of stay (LOS), days - Inflation-adjusted total cost, in 2022 U.S. dollars, computed from total charges using the HCUP cost-to-charge ratio and adjusted using annual Consumer Price Index ratios\n\n\n\nWe report survey-weighted descriptive statistics and compare groups by Impella RP status.\n\n\nPrimary associations were estimated using propensity score IPTW to create a weighted pseudo-population in which measured baseline covariates were balanced between treatment groups. IPTW weights were estimated for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Conceptually, the ATT answers:\n\nAmong hospitalizations that received Impella RP, what would outcomes have been if they had not received Impella RP?\n\nTo preserve national representativeness and account for the NIS complex survey design, we combined weights as:\nFinal analysis weight = (NIS discharge weight) × (IPTW)\nWe assessed covariate balance using standardized mean differences (SMDs) before and after weighting and visualized balance with a Love plot.\n\n\n\nOutcome models were fit using the IPTW-weighted survey design: - Binary outcomes: survey-weighted generalized linear models with quasibinomial family; reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) - LOS and total cost: survey-weighted Gaussian models of log(1 + outcome); exponentiated coefficients are reported as ratios (exp[β]) with 95% CI"
